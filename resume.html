                        <p class="right">This is a digital puppet I made for the kids at church.  I was inspired by a friend's project.
                            However, his version is very different. Use keys 'space','c','v',and 'b' to control him.

                    <p>I've been working at learning every part of the stack for the classes I teach as my students are expected to produce a capstone project at the end of their senior and they can't work on teams. I completed the Reserve a Table section of this UI design.  This came from Meta's Frontend course.</p>
