            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I started bringing my oldest to taekwondo as a cheaper alternative to physical therapy. 
                My second and third children also joined and I found myself in the back of the class trying
                to finish up work on a laptop which didn't work very well. So, I joined as well looking
                for exercise and the shared experience with my kids.<br><br>
                Fishing with my dad has been an important activity since I was a boy.  He would take me back
                to his childhood home on the coast to catch red fish and speckled trout.<br><br>
                Camping both with a scouting group and in an RV is another way I spend time with the people I 
                care about.  I grew up in a group called Royal Rangers, but the best group I've found for my sons is a Trail Life 
                group.

        each caption was causing the images to misalign. -->
