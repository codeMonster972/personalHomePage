            <!-- My story. -->
            <p>I was born August 15, 1980 in Bay City, TX to two 
                <a href="https://www.sagu.edu/" target="SAGU becoming Nelson Univerity">Southwestern Assemblies of God
                College</a> graduates.  They were living down in my father's home town because that's where
                dad had the best ministry prospects at the time.  The ministry doesn't pay a lot, and it 
                paid even less back then.  So, they were living in a house they intended to buy that my 
                grandfather was building.  It wasn't quite finished, and you might question why a family 
                of four with a fifth on the way would live in a house under construction.  Dad drove me past
                some of the other houses last year they lived in previous to the one I was supposed to come home
                to and described the problems in those.  At least the house under construction was warm, dry, and
                had running water.</p>
            <p>Dad was earning money as an electrician and had to get up at 5 am to be at work at 6 or 7.  Mom
                would get up with him and make the coffee, cowboy style on the stove (I'm not sure why.  Maybe
                there wasn't money for a coffee machine.) That morning mom fell back to sleep after she started
                the coffee and the bacon grease they kept in a metal coffee can on the back of the stove caught fire.  So my mom, eight
                months pregnant with me, my dad in his tighty whities, and my two sisters ended up running to the
                neighbors to call the fire truck.  The house didn't burn to the ground, but they didn't have homeowner's
                insurance for all the smoke damage.  So, dad went down and bought a brown and white three bedroom mobile home.</p>
            <p>Well, all of that led to a life of moving around following electrical and church opportunities
                as they came up.  We ended up in Midlothian, TX where mom and dad decided it was best to stop 
                moving when I was five years old.  Life was filled with church, and not just any church - Pentecostal Church.  For the 
                uninitiated that's the one where the preacher speaks loudly and passionately and sweats a lot. 
                The congregation 'Amens' loudly, speaks in tongues, and sometimes runs or falls down.  This 
                has an effect on many of the young people in a church like that, and I was one of them.  I 
                found myself at Dear Ol' Southwestern as well studying to work with the youth of A/G churches.
                I did that work for a while, but found after I married that the demands of family and a church
                job often came into conflict with each other.  I've tried a few other things such as carpentry, 
                investment banking, and teaching.  My latest endevor is to work as a software dev.  That's what
                led me here.  My dad's work led him to automation controls, and he would rub shoulders with
                TSTC graduates, and he would mention to me sometimes about how impressed he was with them.  So, here 
                I am, a bit later than I should have been, but I'm looking forward to what this course of study 
                will bring me.  Thanks for reading.  By the way, my name is JohnMichael. Not John - JohnMichael.
                If you call me John I probably won't correct you because I just get tired of that, but I will 
                think you don't listen well enough to care about what I'm telling you.  I'm married to my wife of 
                almost 16 years, Jamie, and we have three wonderful children - Elliot(13), Grant(11), and Norah(8).
